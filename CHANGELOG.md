# Changelog

All notable changes to Ember are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **[BC BREAK]** `pkg/metrics.HistogramBucket` now encodes an infinite `UpperBound` as the string `"+Inf"` (or `"-Inf"`), the spelling of Prometheus' `le` label, so a snapshot holding the `+Inf` bucket no longer fails to encode with `json: unsupported value: +Inf`. Finite bounds are still plain numbers, byte for byte. `upperBound` can therefore be a number or a string: a plugin that decodes buckets with its own type must accept both, while decoding into `HistogramBucket` handles it. The `--json` output is unaffected, as it still drops that bucket.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- **[BC BREAK]** `--client-cert` given without `--client-key` (or the reverse) now fails instead of connecting with mTLS silently disabled. A setup that started with mTLS quietly off now refuses to start.
- **[BC BREAK]** `ember --json --once` exits non-zero when nothing could be collected, where it used to write an empty file and exit 0, so a redirected snapshot never leaves `ember diff` an empty file to choke on.
- **[BC BREAK]** `ember --daemon --timeout <d>` exits 0 when the timeout expires, matching `--json`. A script reading the exit code to detect the expiry needs to watch the elapsed time instead.
- Ember builds with Go 1.27, up from 1.26, and its dependencies are updated. Installing from source needs the newer toolchain, while the published binaries and the Docker image are unaffected.

### Fixed

- `/healthz` no longer reports `ok` while the monitored Caddy is down: a failed `/metrics` scrape is now reported by the fetcher, so the daemon stops storing a zeroed snapshot stamped with a fresh timestamp, logs the outage, and lets the endpoint go stale.
- A single `NaN` sample no longer swallows the whole `--json` snapshot: non-finite values are read as zero at the parser, and an encoding failure is reported instead of discarded.
- `ember diff` refuses two captures that recorded a fetch error, skips the cumulative counters when the target restarted between them, and names an instance present in only one file instead of diffing it against zero.
- An `EMBER_*` variable exported with no value is treated as unset instead of aborting the command; an empty `EMBER_CONFIG` no longer hides `.ember.toml`.
- `ember init -q` requires `-y`, instead of blocking on a confirmation prompt written to a discarded stream.
- SIGHUP and SIGUSR1 are armed before the daemon's first poll, so a signal sent during startup no longer terminates the process.
- A Caddy log line over 1 MiB no longer ends the log stream for the whole connection.
- A transient admin API failure no longer erases the record of which servers Ember enabled access logs on, so the injected `logs` blocks are still removed on quit.
- A failed `/metrics` scrape is no longer read as a Caddy restart, which was discarding the latency window and the rate baseline on every timeout.
- The TUI marks its first fetch in flight, so the first tick no longer starts a second concurrent fetch against the same process handle.
- A plugin metric family colliding with an Ember one no longer emits a duplicate `# HELP` line, which Prometheus rejects for the whole scrape.
- `ember init` reports a non-2xx answer from the admin API instead of accepting it as reachable.
- `ctrl+c` quits from the detail view and the filter prompt.
- The TUI no longer leaks its listener goroutines on quit.
- FrankenPHP detection honours its refresh interval on plain Caddy instead of probing the admin API on every poll.
- Clearing the log buffer releases the entries it held.
- Ember bootstraps Caddy's logging config only when Caddy rejected the sink write, so a timeout or a server error no longer triggers a write into the shared logging section.
- The plugin metric writer reports the bytes that actually reached the response and stops writing once the stream failed, instead of splicing leftovers into the next plugin's output.

### Security

- Terminal control bytes in a Caddy config object key are scrubbed before the Config tab renders them, extending the CWE-150 neutralization of 1.4.2 to object keys, which were still rendered raw.
- The exposed metrics server sets a read-header timeout, so a client that opens a connection on the shared-network `--expose` endpoint and never finishes its headers can no longer hold it open indefinitely.
- A CA identifier read from the PKI admin API is URL-escaped before it is put in the request path, so an identifier carrying path separators stays inside `/pki/ca/` instead of addressing another endpoint.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-08-17

### Added

- `Avg Mem` and `Max Mem` columns in the Logs tab's By Route view: per-route PHP memory usage sampled from busy FrankenPHP threads, sortable like the latency columns. Helps spot memory-hungry routes, detect leaks in worker mode, and size servers from the max footprint. Requires FrankenPHP 1.12.2 or later, and a terminal wide enough that the columns cost the Pattern column nothing.
- Worker utilization gauge in the FrankenPHP header: worker threads get their own busy/idle/inactive bar, and the existing Threads bar now covers regular threads only. Each bar is drawn only when threads of that kind exist.
- `--stdin-logs` (alias `--from-stdin`, env `EMBER_STDIN_LOGS`): read Caddy logs from standard input instead of hot-registering a net_writer, for read-only or unidirectional environments such as `kubectl logs -f <pod> | ember --stdin-logs`. Incompatible with `--daemon`, `--json` and `--log-listen`.
- `CADDY_API_URL` is accepted as a source for `--addr`, taking precedence over `EMBER_ADDR` when both hold a value.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Config file support (`.ember.toml`): declare a fleet of named endpoints once instead of repeating `--addr`. New `-f`/`--config` flag and `EMBER_CONFIG` env var; `--daemon`, `--json`, `status`, `wait` and `init` fan out across all endpoints; the TUI connects to the saved `default` or shows an interactive picker. `ember config use <name>` sets the TUI default.

### Changed

- Malformed `EMBER_*` environment variable values now abort startup with an explicit error instead of being silently ignored.
- Multi-instance `/healthz` returns 503 when no instance has reported data yet.
- `ember status` no longer scans local processes when the target address is remote.
- Bump dependencies

### Fixed

- Corrupted per-host latency percentiles in `--json` streaming output.
- In-flight requests are summed across all server series instead of reading a single one.
- The per-endpoint `,interval=` suffix is honored in TUI mode, including the `/healthz` staleness threshold when combined with `--expose`.
- `--timeout` applies to each fetch in `ember status`, so a timeout equal to the polling interval works.
- Buffered log lines are no longer lost when the log connection drops.
- The dropped-entries baseline resets when the log buffer is cleared.
- Multi-instance daemon keeps exporting the last known plugin data when a fetch fails, and subscriber-only plugins now receive updates in daemon mode.
- The dashboard stays visible when only part of a fetch fails.
- Ember excludes its own process when scanning for FrankenPHP.
- Global TLS flags are accepted alongside Unix socket endpoints in mixed fleets.
- The Docker image reports its actual version.
- Assorted TUI fixes: cell-aware truncation of host, URI and address columns (wide characters), panel heights clamped to the terminal, Graphs view fits the available height and honors `NO_COLOR`, non-ASCII input accepted in the main filter, logs side panel keeps the selection visible, `Enter` is ignored on empty lists, help overlay counts plugin tabs and shows the `n`/`N` config search shortcuts.

### Security

- `--metrics-auth` credentials are compared in constant time regardless of username validity or credential length, closing a timing side channel on the metrics endpoint.
- Terminal escape sequences are neutralized in the fetch error shown on the connection-error screen.
- `install.sh` verifies the downloaded release archive against the published `checksums.txt` before installing.

## 1.4.3 - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Bump dependencies

## 1.4.2 - 2026-06-22

### Security

- Neutralize terminal control and escape sequences (CWE-150) in attacker-controlled fields rendered by the TUI (request URI, host and method, raw log lines, in-flight FrankenPHP requests, certificate subject and issuer), so untrusted log and metric values can no longer inject ANSI/OSC/CSI sequences into the operator's terminal.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Vim-style tab-select mode: press `t` then `1`-`9` to jump to a tab, `Esc` to cancel.
- `FooterRenderer` plugin interface: plugins can override Ember's global footer hint line while their tab is active by implementing `FooterText(width int) string`.
- Right-of-refusal for `1`-`9` and `t` keys on plugin tabs: the active plugin's `HandleKey` sees them first and can consume them before the default tab-switch.
- Community Plugins section in the plugins documentation!

### Changed

- Bump dependencies

## 1.4.0 - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Multi-instance monitoring: poll several Caddy/FrankenPHP instances at once, with per-instance TLS, polling interval, health check and PID resolution.
- `ember init`, `ember diff`, `ember wait`, `ember status` now support multi-instance setups.
- `ember wait --any`: return as soon as any instance is reachable instead of waiting for all.
- `MultiInstancePlugin` opt-in marker so plugins can receive per-instance `Fetch` calls; plugins without the marker are disabled in multi-instance mode with a warning.
- `ember_instance="<name>"` label on every Prometheus metric (except `ember_build_info`) when `--addr` is repeated; single-instance output is unchanged.
- Access-by-route view.

### Changed

- TUI mode refuses repeated `--addr` with an explicit error pointing at `--daemon` / `--json`; multi-instance is supported only in non-interactive modes.

### Fixed

- `ember status` with multi-instance now distinguishes TLS misconfiguration (`Caddy TLS configuration failed (...)` and a JSON `error` field) from a network outage, instead of reporting both as `UNREACHABLE`.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Plugin system for extending Ember with custom collectors and views.
- Log streaming and runtime logs tab with filtering and breadcrumb navigation.
- DockerHub image distribution.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Upstreams tab.
- Ember self-metrics so operators can monitor the monitor.
- P90 in JSON streaming output derived metrics.
- `-i` short flag as an alias for `--interval`.

### Changed

- **[BC BREAK]** Stop mirroring metrics already exposed by Caddy.
- FrankenPHP tab is always rendered in second position when enabled.
- Better rendering when many PHP threads are present.

### Fixed

- Reject `--timeout` shorter than `--interval` at startup.
- Reject invalid Prometheus metric prefixes at startup.
- Refuse percentiles without a baseline snapshot instead of returning cumulative counts.
- Detect FrankenPHP worker counter reset independently from Caddy.
- Race on `HTTPFetcher` transport during TLS reload.
- Viewport clipping on all tabs.

### Added

- AI agent skills shipped with the project.
- `Shift+Tab` cycles to the previous tab.

### Changed
