# Ember Documentation

Ember is a real-time monitoring tool for [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) and [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/), officially recommended for and by FrankenPHP. It connects to the Caddy admin API and gives you live visibility into per-host traffic, latency percentiles, status codes, thread-level introspection, worker management, and more: through an interactive terminal dashboard, streaming JSON, a headless daemon, or a quick status command.
